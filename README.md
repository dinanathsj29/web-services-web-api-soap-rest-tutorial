1 Introduction to Web Service
=====================

1.1. What is Web Service?
---------------------

`Web Service is a standardized way or medium for communication` between client and server applications to exchange data on the World Wide Web

`Web Services provides a standard protocol/format` and helps to communicate between two different application and make sure all things happening smooth-proper and successful

`Web Services provide a common platform` that allows multiple applications built on various programming languages to communicate and have the ability to communicate with each other

- Scenario: Java programming language can interact with PHP/ASP and .Net, JavaScript by using Web Services

Example: 
> **`Hotel/Restaurant`**
  - The waiter is a mediator (Act as a Web Service/Bridge) between two application ie. customer and kitchen

> **`Flight Booking websites`**

1.2. Benefits of Web Service
---------------------

Here are some of the benefits and advantages of using Web Services:


- **`Platform independent communication`**: Web Service provides platform/Operating System independent communication
- **`Applications can Exchange Data`**: Through Web Services, different applications/implementations can talk to each other and exchange data/information
- **`Exposing Business Functionality`**/existing functions on the network so other applications can use the functionality of your program
- **`Interoperability`** amongst applications (Web services allow various applications to talk/share data and services among themselves)
- Web Services use **`standardized industry protocol`** for the communication which everybody understands
- **`Reduction in cost`** of communication/Low-Cost Communication

1.3. Web Service Architecture
---------------------

The Web Services architecture consists of three distinct roles as given below:

1. **`Service Provider`**: The provider creates/implements the Web Service and makes it available on the internet to other client application who want to use it
2. **`Service Requestor`**: Requestor is consumer/client application that utilizes an existing web service by sending an XML request. The client application can be a .Net, Java, JavaScript or other language application which looks some sort of functionality via a web service
3. **`Service Registry/Broker`**: The registry is a logically centralized directory of services where developers can publish new services or find existing ones ( like centralized clearinghouse or brokerage house for companies and their services). The broker is an application provides access to the `UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration)` which enables the client application to locate the web service
